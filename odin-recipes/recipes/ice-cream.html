            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol class="text">
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the heavy cream, whole milk, granulated sugar, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Whisk together until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is smooth.</li>
            <li>Cover the mixing bowl with plastic wrap or a lid and place it in the refrigerator to chill for at least 2 hours, or until the mixture is thoroughly chilled.</li>
            <li>If you're using an electric ice cream maker, follow the manufacturer's instructions to assemble and pre-chill the machine. If you're using a manual ice cream maker, make sure the inner container is frozen according to the manufacturer's guidelines.</li>
            <li>Once the ice cream mixture is chilled, pour it into the ice cream maker's freezer bowl.</li>
            <li>Turn on the ice cream maker and let it churn the mixture according to the manufacturer's instructions. This typically takes about 20-30 minutes, or until the ice cream reaches a soft-serve consistency.</li>
            <li>If you'd like to add any mix-ins, such as chocolate chips, chopped nuts, or fruit, you can gently fold them into the partially churned ice cream during the last few minutes of churning.</li>
            <li>Once the ice cream reaches the desired consistency, turn off the ice cream maker and transfer the ice cream to a freezer-safe container with a tight-fitting lid.</li>
            <li>Place the container of ice cream in the freezer and let it freeze for at least 4 hours, or until it's firm enough to scoop.</li>
            <li>When you're ready to enjoy the ice cream, remove it from the freezer and let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes to soften slightly.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
