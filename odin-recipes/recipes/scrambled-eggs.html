    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Scrambled eggs are a quick and versatile dish made by whisking eggs and cooking them until they are softly set. They can be enjoyed for breakfast, brunch, or even as a light meal or snack any time of the day.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Butter or oil (for cooking)</li>
        <li>Optional: Milk or cream (for creamier eggs)</li>
        <li>Optional toppings: Chopped herbs (such as chives or parsley), grated cheese, diced vegetables, cooked bacon or ham</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Crack the desired number of eggs into a mixing bowl. Typically, 2-3 eggs per person are sufficient for a serving of scrambled eggs.</li>
        <li>Add a pinch of salt and a sprinkle of pepper to the eggs in the mixing bowl. You can adjust the seasoning according to your taste preferences.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional: </strong>If you prefer creamier scrambled eggs, you can add a splash of milk or cream to the eggs in the mixing bowl. Whisk together until well combined.</li>
        <li>Using a whisk or fork, beat the eggs until the yolks and whites are fully combined and the mixture becomes slightly frothy.</li>
        <li>Place a non-stick skillet or frying pan over medium heat. Allow the pan to preheat for a minute or two.</li>
        <li>Once the pan is hot, add a small amount of butter or oil to coat the bottom of the pan. This will prevent the eggs from sticking and add flavor.</li>
        <li>Pour the beaten eggs into the preheated pan. Allow them to cook undisturbed for a few seconds until they start to set around the edges.</li>
        <li>Using a spatula, gently push the cooked edges of the eggs towards the center of the pan while tilting the pan to allow the uncooked eggs to flow to the edges. Continue this motion until the eggs are softly set but still slightly moist.</li>
        <li>If desired, sprinkle any toppings such as chopped herbs, grated cheese, diced vegetables, or cooked bacon or ham over the scrambled eggs while they are still in the pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong></li>
    </ol>
