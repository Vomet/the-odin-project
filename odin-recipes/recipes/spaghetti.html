    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti is a beloved Italian pasta dish known for its long, thin, cylindrical noodles typically made from durum wheat semolina. This classic dish is often paired with a variety of sauces, such as marinara (tomato-based), Bolognese (meat-based), Alfredo (cream-based), or aglio e olio (garlic and olive oil), among others.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti pasta</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Olive oil (optional)</li>
        <li>Marinara sauce (or any sauce of your choice)</li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</li>
        <li>Fresh basil or parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with water, leaving enough room for the spaghetti to cook without sticking together.</li>
        <li>Add a generous amount of salt to the water. The water should taste like seawater; this helps flavor the pasta.</li>
        <li>Place the pot of water on the stove over high heat and bring it to a rolling boil.</li>
        <li>Once the water is boiling, carefully add the spaghetti to the pot, using tongs or a pasta fork to gently separate the strands.</li>
        <li>Stir the spaghetti occasionally to prevent sticking and cook according to the package instructions or until it reaches the desired level of tenderness (usually around 8-10 minutes for al dente).</li>
        <li>Once the spaghetti is cooked to your liking, turn off the heat and carefully drain it in a colander placed in the sink. Be cautious of the hot steam.</li>
        <li>Return the drained spaghetti to the pot and drizzle with a bit of olive oil, if desired, to prevent sticking. Toss gently to coat.</li>
        <li>Pour the desired amount of marinara sauce (or any sauce of your choice) over the spaghetti and toss until evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
